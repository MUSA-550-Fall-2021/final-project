# Final Project

The final project is to replicate the pipeline approach on a dataset (or
datasets) of your choosing.

Students will be required to use several of the analysis techniques taught in the class and produce a web-based data visualization that effectively communicates the empirical results to a non-technical audience. The final product should also include a description of the methods used in each step of the data science process (collection, analysis, and visualization).

## Grading

The final project is worth 40% of the final grade and will be graded on five criteria:

- **Concept**: Is it sufficiently complex/challenging/sophisticated? Is the final product useful/interesting/creative? Does it satisfy all of the requirements?
- **Technical implementation**: Was it well thought out? Was each step done correctly? Does it work as described? Is it consistent with the proposal?
- **Analysis**: Is the analysis used sufficiently complex? Are enough different techniques used, according to the requirements? Is each step done correctly?
- **Visualization**: How well does the data visualization serve its purpose? Does it tell a clear story? Are the colors/layout/titles well-chosen?
- **Writeup**: Is all of the above explained clearly? The writeup should be a multi-page document that explains in depth all aspects of the project's implementation as well as the final results.
